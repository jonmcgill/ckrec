Commands, patterns, and principles of worship found in the Scriptures shape the
content and order of our Holy Communion service. The basic form of our liturgy
is found in the Book of Common Prayer of the Reformed Episcopal Church. It
employs liturgical patterns, songs, prayers, and words that are thoroughly based
on Scripture or come directly from it.

## The Order of Service

The order of service is a tool to help us attend to the worship of God with
our whole being. Each piece of the service helps us focus on a different aspect
of God, His work in our lives, and what He expects from us as faithful covenant
men and women. We hope to touch some truth about God, to be encouraged, challenged,
convicted, fed, restored, and changed by our time with Him. Notice that the entire
service is a series of God speaking and we responding. It follows a pattern of
covenant renewal.

## 1. God Calls Us to Worship

God calls us to worship Him. We come for no other reason. An incredible, unique,
and miraculous event takes place every Lord's Day as the people of God come from
wherever they are and gather to worship Him. Our worship begins at home as we
prepare to come. We convene as His assembly, His called out ones, to do business
with Him, not as individuals but as a body of people, not as a collection of rafts
but as a ship. We are troops presenting ourselves for review before our Superior
Officer. We come to give God a command performance. Together, we go on a journey
into heaven, into the presence of the Almighty God, the Holy One. There we join
with all the angels, the hosts of heaven, and all of God's people in songs and
praise. We offer ourselves to Him again as living sacrifices and renew our
covenant with Him. Our worship helps insure that He is preeminent in all matters
individual and corporate as our dread, Sovereign Lord and as our loving Father.

- **The Procession** - Come into His presence with thanksgiving and enter His
courts with praise. The procession speaks of our coming out of the world to
participate in the worship of Almighty God.

- **Prologue** - Blessed be God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
And blessed be His Kingdom now and forever. Amen. The destination of the journey
is announced at the beginning, it is the goal, the end of all our desires and
interests. We are going to follow Christ in His ascension to the Father. Our
"amen" acknowledges and accepts that the kingdom of God is the Church's ultimate
destination.

- **Greeting** - The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. This is a prayerful
greeting for the fullness of God's life to be with us – a kind of "fare well
on the journey this morning." It also acknowledges that we must make the journey
together.

- **Collect for Purity** - The collect collects all of our thoughts and helps
us to focus together on what we are about to do. We prepare our hearts to worship.

## 2. God Instructs Us

Here Christ, the Logos, visits us in His Word. He exposes any sin, error,
deception, or waywardness in thought or practice. The Word teaches, reproves,
corrects, and trains us. We should be on the edge of our seats intently listening
to hear what the Lord might say to us from His Word.

**Decalogue or Summary of the Law** – These state the terms of the covenant.

**Lord have Mercy** – Our response is ‘Lord, have mercy' because we cannot and do
not ever perfectly love or obey the Lord, or one another.

**Scripture Readings** – Paul exhorts Timothy not to neglect the public reading
of Scripture. The Scriptures are primarily intended to be heard, not read silently,
so we should never neglect to read them on the LORD's Day. The Old Covenant Reading
is the voice of the Old Covenant saints. The Epistle Reading is the voice of
the Apostles and Prophets. The Gospel Reading, the Voice of Jesus, is read in the
middle of the congregation to remind us that Jesus became flesh, dwelt among us,
and taught us.

**Creeds** – The Creeds represent the voice of the New Covenant Church. By reciting
the creeds we affirm our commitment to "the faith once delivered to the saints."

**Song** – We rejoice in God's speaking and His great gifts

**Pastoral Prayer** – An elder, as a representative of the church and as God's delegated
authority, leads the congregation in prayer before the Lord.

**Sermon** – God has given gifts of teaching and preaching to the church. The teacher
seeks to make clearer and more practical for us the teachings of Scripture. The
message should challenge us, convict us, instruct us, and encourage us. To listen
well and be attentive often requires work on our part.

## 3. God Restores and Glorifies Us

Here we respond to all God has said.

**Offertory** – We affirm our commitment to God and His world by offering the sacrifices
of the tithe (one tenth of our increase) and offerings. We acknowledge He is the source
of all provision and return our life to Him. The tithes support and strengthen the local
church by providing for its pastors and ministries thereby extending His kingdom into
the world. Offerings are often given to meet particular needs.

**Prayer for the Church Militant** – We pray for the health and strength of Christ's
entire Church.

**Exhortation** – Challenges us to seriously deal with our sins before we take communion.
The communion table is a place of blessing or judgment depending on whether we take
dealing with our sins seriously.

**Confession of Sin** – Before God and His Word we all fall short. We have done things
we ought not to have done and we did not do things we should have done. We also sin
in ignorance. We dare not come to a holy God harboring sin in our hearts so we must
confess our sins. "Who may ascend to the hill of the Lord and who may stand in His
holy place. He who has clean hands and a pure heart, and has not lifted up his soul
unto falsehood." We are ready after the confession to finish our ascension together
into heaven.

**Assurance of Pardon/Comfortable Words** – "If we confess our sins He is faithful
and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." God restores
and glorifies us as persons, a process that continues throughout the service. With
our sins confessed and forgiven, with our consciences washed and cleansed from defilement,
we are now able to move on in our corporate journey as holy, forgiven people into
the fellowship of our God.

**Sursum Corda** – This phrase means "lift up your hearts". It symbolizes the
completion our ascension into heaven where we will worship with angels and archangels
and all the host of heaven before God, where He is seated on His heavenly throne.
We say or sing with them the words of this heavenly worship song which is called the...

**Ter Sanctus** – meaning "three holies". Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts.

## 4. God Feeds Us

Now Christ the Word is present and speaks to us in the sacrament of Holy Communion.

**Consecration of the Bread and Wine** – "This is My Body...This is My Blood" — This
is not the same bread and wine you have on Saturday night.

**Prayer of Oblation** – We present ourselves, our souls and bodies, to be a
reasonable, holy, and living sacrifice unto God.

**Lord's Prayer** – We establish the Lordship of Christ over all of life.

**Prayer of Humble Access (to the Lord's Table)** – He has invited us to come but we
can never approach God on our own merits. We thank Him for making us worthy.

**Holy Communion/The Lord's Supper** – Everything in the meeting so far leads us
to this point. We just listened to the Lord's counsel and commands. He spoke and
we are to respond, to say, "Yes, Lord," (AMEN) and agree to do all that He has
spoken. We accept His appraisal of our lives by confessing our sins. Now we rest,
we feast, we enjoy the fruits of His salvation, and we receive the food of His
body and blood. Meals in the Scripture are the place where covenants are affirmed
and reaffirmed. This meal is no different. By taking the Lord's Supper we are
renewing our covenant with Him. To eat and drink this meal of bread and wine with
the Lord we reaffirm our loyalty to Him and restate our intention to obey Him in
everything He has commanded. We kneel when we take communion because, in the
Scriptures, kneeling is a position of humility and thankfulness. This is a time
of thanksgiving and enjoying the fruits of His victory over sin and death. It
is a time for remembering the Lord's death. It is a time for remembering the
resurrection. It is a time to look forward to the Lamb's Marriage Supper at
the end of this age.

**Song** – We rejoice in God's giving His great gifts

## 5. God Commissions Us

Yahweh has called us, instructed us, restored and glorified us, fed us, and
now He commissions us and sends us into the world to be ambassadors for Him,
to be light in the world, to be His witnesses, to expose the unfruitful deeds
of darkness, to walk in a manner that is worthy of Him, to do good to all
men especially to those in the household of faith, to do good works, and to
live our lives sacrificially for the life of the world.

**Prayer of Thanksgiving** – Prayer is the first work of the people of God.
We pray as He commands for grace to live in Him and for Him.

**Gloria in Excelsis** – This is the desire and goal of our lives – the glory of God.

**Benediction** – The minister speaks a "good word" that we all may find the
grace of God to engage faithfully in our ruling activities, to live holy and
blameless lives, and be faithful witnesses to Him.

**Recession** – We leave God's presence to go and live for the life of the world.
We shine as lights before all men to bring honour and glory to our Lord Jesus Christ.
