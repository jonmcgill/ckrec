Join us Sunday mornings, 9:00 AM - 9:50 AM, for our weekly Sunday School.

## Godly Play

Available for ages 3-7, Godly Play is a program of Christian Education based on
the Montessori Educational philosophy. Godly Play is based upon the recognition
that children have an innate sense of the presence of God. All they lack is the
appropriate language to help them identify and express it so it can be explored
and strengthened. The Godly Play approach teaches classical Christian language
in a way that enhances the child’s authentic experience of God so it can
contribute to the creative life of the child and the world.

## Children's Sunday School

For kids older than 7, this Sunday School time is spent exploring Scripture
in a variety of ways with the aim of learning the fundamental foundations of
Christian theology, worship, and habits.

## Adult Sunday School

Covering various topics and relevant for high school ages and up, the adult
Sunday school hour is a time for God’s people to more intently investigate
how the gospel of Jesus Christ shapes all of life. We learn about church
history, walk through books of the Bible, and discuss current cultural ideas
and events. Light refreshments and coffee are provided. Come prepared to
think deeply and discuss charitably.
