Built upon the foundation of the authoritative Word of God, the Holy Scriptures,
the [Reformed Episcopal Church](http://www.recus.org/) sets her highest priority on biblical worship
and declares her commitment to the work of evangelism, the bold and unadulterated
proclamation of salvation by grace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ (Acts 8:4).
In keeping the faith once delivered to the saints, the Reformed Episcopal Church,
however, does not believe evangelism to be the end, but rather the beginning of
her divinely given vocation.

In addition to being evangelical, she is deeply committed to discipleship, the
work of training evangelized men and women in Christian living (St. Matthew 28:20).
When the Gospel is truly proclaimed and the mercies of God are made known,
redeemed men and women must be led to offer their bodies as a living sacrifice,
which is their spiritual service (Romans 12:1). Thus, the Reformed Episcopal
Church understands the Christian life to be necessarily corporate. The Gospel
call of salvation is not only to a savior, but also to a visible communion
(I Cor.12:27) which, being indwelt by Christ’s Spirit, transcends both temporal
and geographic bounds.

Therefore, the Reformed Episcopal Church is creedal, following the historic
catholic faith as it was confessed by the early undivided Church in the
Apostles’ (A.D. 150), Nicene (A.D. 325) and Athanasian Creeds (circa. A.D. 401);
sacramental, practicing the divinely ordained sacraments of Baptism and the
Lord’s Supper as outward and visible signs of His inward and spiritual grace;
liturgical, using the historic Book of Common Prayer; and Episcopal, finding
unity with the Church of the earliest Christian eras through submission to
the government of godly bishops.

In this fashion, by embracing the broad base of doctrine and practice inherent
in apostolic Christianity received by the Church of the English Reformation
and expressed in the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion, the Reformed Episcopal
Church has a foundation for effective ministry in the name of Christ to a world
which is lost and dying without Him.
